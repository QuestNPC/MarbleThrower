### Summary of the idea:

Our idea is to make a device for throwing marbles. Initial concept was a catapult that was operated by servo, had ability to rotate, and responded to the distance of the target.

### Week 12

This week was mostly discussing and developing our idea for throwing marbles. Wednesday was our first discussion with whole group where we brainstormed what is presented in the introductory report.
On Friday we discussed the idea during the TA session and we got confirmation on our worries that servo might not be able to operate the arm well enough by itself. Also TA reminded us to focus on figuring out how we will impement the throwing before working on other functionalities. TA mentioned the trebuchet that was made few years back, however trebuchet uses counterweight to swing and the students used servo to pull the rope that pulled the arm back.

After the TA session we discussed the idea futher, this time exploring using springs to move the arm and sevro to tension it, we had a passing mention of this during discussion on wednesday and that was decided as possible back up if TA session confirmed servo insufficent. Discussing and researching implementations made by other people in the internet we updated the arm to be held down with a lever operated with servo, while another servo tensions the arm by rotating another arm that has a rubberband connected to the throwing arm.

Rough sketch of the updated idea.


### Week 13

This week we started to actually work on the project. Aki started making a 3d model of the preject after fiddling around with Autodesk Fusion 360, which is our software of choise for the project. What Aki managed to make was a basic structure of our throwing machine. What needs to be made is to modify the structure to fit the components. There was a patheic attemt at animating joints to simulate the throwing motion, after a while of fiddling around success is yet to be found. Some understanding wass gained but not enough for the results to be satisfactory as of now.

Antti also picked up circuit design and code using Tinkercad as the platform. So far he has managed to implement 2 servos to roate in response to a button press.
